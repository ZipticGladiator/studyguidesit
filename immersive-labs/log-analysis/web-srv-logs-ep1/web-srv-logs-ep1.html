      <h2>Web Server Logs: Ep.1 â€” What are Web Server Logs?</h2>
      <p>Web server logs are text files that are</p>
      <p>automatically generated and maintained by a web server</p>
      <br />

      <p>The high rate at which data is generated by these logs means that the server</p>
      <p>will often delete logs after a designated period of time</p>
      <br>

      <p>Web logs are often generated in a</p>
      <p>Common Log Format (CLF) and Combined Log Format</p>
      <br>

      <p>Web logs allow you to</p>
      <p>gather information about the type of users (and bots) that visit your website or application</p>
      <br>

      <p>A log file which creates a record every time a client requests access to your website or application</p>
      <p>Access log</p>
      <br>

      <p>A log file which contains all errors that occur on the web server</p>
      <p>Error log</p>
      <br>

      <p>Web server logs can be used to</p>
      <p>develop a timeline for incident response investigations</p>
      <br>
