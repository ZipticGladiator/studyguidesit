      <h2>Wireshark Display Filters: Combining Filters</h2>
      <p>ip.src == 10.10.10.10 && tcp.port == 80. What does this line of code do?
      </p>
      <p>Filter capture to show all packets sent from 10.10.10.10 on port 80
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>From the PCAP provided, apply a filter to display all packets on UDP dstport 59485 with
        the destination IP 10.6.5.102. What is the transaction ID of this packet response? </p>
      <p>0x0000d27b</p>
      <br>

      <p>From the PCAP provided, apply a filter to display all web traffic {http.request or ssl.handshake.type == 1}. What
        percentage of results are then displayed in the capture?
      </p>
      <p>0.3%</p>
      <br>

      <p>Now take the filter used in the previous question, and add an OR expression which filters by (...tcp flags
         equal to 0x0002) and a further expression which filters by packets NOT to/from (tcp port 25). What 
         percentage of results are then displayed in the capture?
      </p>
      <p>0.8%</p>
      <br>

      <p>Now using the same filter, alter the tcp flags expression to include a OR dns. What percentage of the results
        are then displayed in the capture?
      </p>
      <p>1.9%</p>
